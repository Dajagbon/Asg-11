**a) Purpose of the Program(s):** The purpose of the dictionary program is to create dictionaries to represent a standard deck of 52 playing cards using the specified schema. 

The purpose of the protein program is to have a function that takes an RNA molecule as an input and will output the encoded protein. 

**b) Input:** The dictionary program does not have an input. The protein program input is the RNA sequence.

**c) Expected Output:** The dictionary program does not have an output. The protein program output is the length of the encoded protein, the most commonly occurring codon, and lastly, the encoded protein.

**d) Type of Execution:** The type(s) of execution for the dictionary program is sequential execution and the protein program is conditional execution. Adding comments.

**e) Possible Improvements:** The dictionary  program could be improved by: making a better structure for the dictionary by using nested dictionaries or lists of tuples.

The protein program could be improved by: adding handle upper and lower case input and adding comments.
